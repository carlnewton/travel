# Travel

This is a silly personal project for tracking a friend's tour of the world.

## Development

- Run `npm install gulp` upon first downloading the repository.
- Make changes in the `/src` directory and run `gulp` to build `/dist/js/script.js` or run `gulp watch` to have it build each time a file is updated in the `/src` directory.
